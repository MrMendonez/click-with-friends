Click Your Friends

This week, you will be building your first JavaScript-loaded web page. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a very simple game. There will be a single web page that acts as the user interface. It shall be glorious!
 
Using Bootstrap, design a page that has a grid of 20 of your friends faces. Have a “Start” button that kicks off a 20 second timer and then count the number of faces a player can click in that time.
 
Once the 20 seconds is up, give the user an alert with how many faces they clicked. You cannot count the same face being clicked multiple times.
